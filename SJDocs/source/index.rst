Juggler is a real time stream processing platform designed for building both simple and complex event processing (CEP). Juggler uses Apache Messos, Kafka and T-streams to construct scalable and flexible processing algorithms. Juggler functions on the same principle as Apache Samza, but enables exactly-once processing and provides an integrated solution with a RESTful interface, JavaScript UI and an ad hoc repository for modules, services, streams and other data processing pipeline components.
